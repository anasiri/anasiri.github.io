<!-- ======= Portfolio Details ======= -->

<p>
  SmartClass was a five-person group project for the IoT class in 2021, intending to create an intelligent device to increase security in university classrooms.
</p>
<p>
  We had a couple of tasks to handle:
    <br>
  1) Detect humans from a camera and log them into the database.
   <br>
  2) Auto-lock and unlock the class door.
    <br>
  3) Check the attendance of teachers and students.
   <br>
  4) Develop an admin panel for the security team.
 </p>

<p>
  I worked on the project's hardware and artificial intelligence components.
