    This project aims to:
</p>
<p>
  1) Develop a physics-based simulation for the LiDAR sensor using deep learning on real-world data to decrease the discrepancy between the real LiDAR and currently common simulations.
</p>
<p>
  2) Generate 3D assets automatically from the LiDAR point cloud instead of hiring a graphic designer to create the asset, so the generated assets are faster and cheaper to build. Also, these assets are used for a LiDAR simulation environment, so building them from LiDAR point clouds represents the real-world properties of LiDAR sensors much better. Note that these generated assets can be used for any LiDAR sensor, regardless of how they are created.
</p>
<p>
  3) Generate critical safety scenarios using adversarial attacks on motion planning modules. These scenarios can help researchers examine the shortcomings of their motion planning models.
